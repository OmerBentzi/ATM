Just like our daily operations we are implementing the same features in this program, like: deposit cash, withdraw money, check balance, change PIN number etc.
Firstly, a predefined PIN is initialized in this program, so that it can be matched with the given (input) PIN number. And then we select the operations given in the program. Based on the selected operation program will work.
